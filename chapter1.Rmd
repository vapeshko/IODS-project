# About the project

## How am I feeling right now?
- Overwhelmed
- Excited
- Slightly confused

It feels as if you gave us written instructions to teach us how to swim, and now I am in the water, trying to understand these instructions and not to drown.

## What do I expect to learn?
I would like to learn the how to perform statistical analysis with R.  

## Where did I hear about the course?
I've found the course when I was looking for options to learn data science in *University of Helsinki*.
